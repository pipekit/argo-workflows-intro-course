## Contributing

Changes are propagated to Killercoda's CDN once committed to `master` branch. So this means you changes must be on `master` to be seen. This means you will need to fork this repo and set up your own Killercoda scenario in order to preview your changes.

If you open a PR with major changes to the code or assets (i.e. not just changing text or fixing typos), please include a link to your version of the Killercoda course (if possible) so we can preview it before merging.

Tips:
* Killercoda can take a few minutes to replicate changes, so it can be easier to link to assets than to embed them.
* Once you've created a Creator account with Killercoda, you can see when changes were pulled by looking at your [scenarios page](https://killercoda.com/creator/scenarios). You can also manually trigger the webhook from this page to view your updates on `master`.
